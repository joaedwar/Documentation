= Arotna Mindmap

Push adoc to publish

Arotna doesn't proscribe a method for doing things, but an order to making decisions:

WIP

* <<Choosing a UI>>
* <<Choosing an editor>>
* <<Choosing a hosting service>>
* <<Choosing a sync service>>
* <<Choosing a git service>>
* <<Configuring asciidoctor.js>>
* <<Choosing templates, convention, and styles>>
* <<Writing content>>
* <<Integrating>>
* <<Integrations>>

== Choosing a UI

Typically, you'd use:

* <<PatternFly>> - the default
* <<Bare>>

You might want to contribute:

* <<PatternFly 4>>
* link:https://asciidoctor.org/docs/asciidoctor-revealjs/[Reveal.js]]

== Choosing an editor

Editors include:

* link:https://atom.io/[Atom]
* VSCode
* <<Using Joplin>>

== Choosing a hosting service

Typically, you host the Asciidoc and HTML files on:

* <<GitHub>> Pages

== Choosing a sync service

Typically, you'd use <<Joplin>>:

* Dropbox
* Onedrive
* Nextcloud

But you might want to develop your own solution using:

* https://github.com/aerogear/voyager-server[Voyager]

== Choosing a git service

Typically you would use:

* GitHub - GitHub pages is documented at [TODO]
* GitLab

== Configuring asciidoctor.js

Asciidoctor.js modes include:

* safe
* secure
* unsafe

See the link:https://asciidoctor-docs.netlify.com/asciidoctor/1.5/safe-modes/[Asciidoctor.js documentation].

== Choosing templates, convention, and styles

You can use Arotna with:

* simple markdown
* a topic based authoring (for example, mod docs)

== Integrating

You might want to develop the following type of integration;

* a new UI
* a new editor
* a new sync system
* tests
* JavaScript manipulation of content

See <<Integrations>> for a list of existing integrations.

== Integrations

Existing integrations include:

* <<GitHub>>
** Web hosting
* <<Joplin>> - an open source notes/evernote typic application
** Dropbox
** WebDav

See <<Integrating>> for information on developing your own integrations.

== Writing content

You must write content in link:https://asciidoc.org[AsciiDoc].
Typically, you write:

* Headings (`=` prefixed lines)
* Bullets (`*` prefixed lines)
* links (`link:<url>[title]`)


=== PatternFly 3

This is the default UI. You can either:

* use a template and only edit AsciiDoc to change content
* edit the PatternFly app, rebuild and change behaviour (app development)

=== Bare HTML file

. Add the asciidoctor.js library to your HTML
. Add and edit the AsciiDoc files to publish content 

=== PatternFly 4

PatternFly 4 is new and under development

=== Using Joplin

link:https://joplin.cozic.net/[Joplin] is a note taking app that primarily uses markdown to capture 'evernote' style content. It provides synchronization across multiple devices, and that sync can support multiple users.
